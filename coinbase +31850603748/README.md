## Scam Tactics

### 1. Impersonation & Urgency Creation

The scammers impersonate Coinbase, instilling fear and urgency by referencing unauthorized withdrawals.

### 2. Fraudulent Automated Phone System

Victims who call the number are greeted by an automated message recorded by a female voice:

> "Welkom bij Coinbase support. Heeft u een bericht ontvangen met een verificatiecode die u niet heeft aangevraagd, druk dan op 1. Voor technische ondersteuning druk u op twee. Wilt u een medewerker spreken druk dan op drie. Wij danken u voor het contacteren van Coinbase."

**Translation**:

> "Welcome to Coinbase support. If you have received a message with a verification code you did not request, press 1. For technical support, press 2. If you wish to speak to an employee, press 3. Thank you for contacting Coinbase."

Anonymous calls are discarded, and conference calls are not answered, likely to evade detection.
