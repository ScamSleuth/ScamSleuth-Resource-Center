## Scam Tactics  

### 1. Impersonation & Fear Tactics  
The scammers impersonate the Dutch Tax Office and claim immediate legal action will be taken unless the victim pays. They use urgency and legal threats to manipulate victims.  

### 2. Fraudulent Website or Payment Link  
The scam website mimics a legitimate invoice page and directs users to fake iDeal or Bunq payment links. Victims are prompted to enter:  
- Personal information (name, address, phone number)  
- Banking credentials via iDeal payment gateway  
- Direct bank transfers to an account linked to **Granit Hoxha** (NL39 BUNQ 2042 7049 03)  

### 3. Fake Customer Support or Chatbot  
A chatbot, operated via **Tawk.to**, collects personal and banking information from victims, making the scam appear more legitimate.
