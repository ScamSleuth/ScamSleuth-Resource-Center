## Scam Tactics  

### 1. Impersonation & Fear Tactics  
Scammers pretended to be Ledger, a trusted cryptocurrency security company, to induce fear and urgency in victims. The message implied immediate action was required to prevent security risks.

### 2. Fraudulent Website or Payment Link  
Clicking on [www.security-legder.live](http://www.security-legder.live) redirected users through multiple fraudulent websites before reaching a phishing page:  
- **[https://boom1973.youcan.store](https://boom1973.youcan.store)**
- **[https://rocketpool-rpl-shares-net-17598549.codeanyapp.com/atest/LG/connect.html](https://rocketpool-rpl-shares-net-17598549.codeanyapp.com/atest/LG/connect.html)**  

The final site prompted users to enter their **12 or 24-word seed phrase**, which was then stored on a scammer-controlled server before redirecting victims to Ledger's real website.  

### 3. Fake Customer Support or Chatbot  
No chatbot or customer support was used. The scam relied entirely on automated SMS phishing (smishing).
