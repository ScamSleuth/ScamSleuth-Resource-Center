**Scam Date**: June 2025

**Status**: Ongoing

## Scam Summary

Victims receive a fraudulent SMS claiming to be from **Bitvavo**, stating a password reset has been requested. If unrecognized, the message urges the user to call a Dutch landline. Upon calling, victims are later contacted by scammers claiming to be from **Ledger**, warning about suspicious activity in **Germany** on the user's Ledger Nano S.

## Scam Tactics

### 1. Password Reset Warning (Bitvavo Impersonation)

Creates urgency and fear of account compromise. A reference code (e.g., **BITXXXX**) adds legitimacy but is likely static or irrelevant.

### 2. Call Screening Behavior

* Calls from an **anonymous or 08X number** are answered silently.
* Calls from a **known 06-number** receive **on-hold music**, indicating screening or call queue filtering.

### 3. Follow-Up Voice Call (Ledger Impersonation)

Just after calling +31 20 226 2079, without answer the victims are contacted by scammers using number **020-7223816**, claiming to be **Ledger support**. The narrative shifts to a **Ledger Nano S login in Germany**, likely an attempt to phish for wallet passphrases or recovery seeds. Both numbers are numbers belonging to the scammers and aren't spoofed.

## Lessons & Takeaways

### 1. Red Flags & Prevention

- **Unsolicited SMS about password resets with a phone number**  
  Always verify directly via the official Bitvavo or Ledger website ‚Äî *never* through links or numbers provided in a message.

- **Urgency to call a landline to ‚Äústop unauthorized access‚Äù**  
  Scammers create pressure to trigger impulsive actions. Always take a moment to verify the claim.

- **Reference codes like `BITXXXX` that appear official**  
  These are fake but designed to look trustworthy. Real platforms use secure in-app messaging, not generic SMS codes.

- **Follow-up calls from ‚ÄúLedger Support‚Äù**  
  Ledger explicitly states it will **never** contact users by phone. Any such call is a scam.

- **Mentions of suspicious logins from abroad (e.g., Germany)**  
  This scare tactic is used to extract sensitive information like wallet recovery phrases. Never share your seed phrase under any circumstance.

### 2. How to Stay Safe  
- Never trust links or phone numbers in unsolicited messages.  
- Report scams to relevant authorities as soon as possible.
