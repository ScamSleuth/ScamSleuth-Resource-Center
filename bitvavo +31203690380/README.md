## Scam Tactics

### 1. Suspicious Login Alert (Location-Based Fear)

Creates immediate concern by claiming unauthorized access from a foreign location (**Antwerp, Belgium**). The specific time (18:30) and location add false legitimacy to the alert.

### 2. Direct Action Demand

Unlike typical scams that offer options, this message uses **"Bel direct"** (Call immediately), creating pressure for instant response without time to verify the claim.

### 3. Multi-Person Operation

Research confirms **multiple scammers** operate from the same number, suggesting a coordinated call center operation rather than individual fraud attempts.

## Lessons & Takeaways

### 1. Red Flags & Prevention

- **Unsolicited SMS about suspicious logins with phone numbers**  
  Always verify login activity directly via the official Bitvavo website or app â€” *never* through numbers provided in messages.

- **Location-based scare tactics (foreign cities like Antwerp)**  
  Scammers use geographic fear to trigger immediate response. Take time to verify through official channels.

- **Urgent language like "Bel direct" (Call immediately)**  
  Pressure tactics are designed to bypass rational thinking. Legitimate platforms provide multiple verification options.

- **Multiple operators on the same scam number**  
  Indicates organized fraud operations rather than individual attempts, suggesting higher risk and coordination.
