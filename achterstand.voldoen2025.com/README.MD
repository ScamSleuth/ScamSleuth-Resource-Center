**Scam Tactics**:  
- **Mimicked Invoice**: The website displays a fake invoice, imitating the Dutch Tax Office, demanding immediate payment.

### Actions Taken:

2. **Google Safe Search** has been informed of this fraudulent website,
3. **Cloudflare** has been informed of this fraudulent website,
4. **Tidio.net** has been informed of the use of their services on their website,

### Follow-Up:

### Lessons & Takeaways:

1. **Source Red Flags**: Any unsolicited messages threatening immediate legal action or financial penalties should be treated with extreme caution.
2. **Domain Name Red Flags**: The domain **mijn-schulden.com** is suspicious. Official Dutch services would rather use **.nl** domain extensions, not **.com**.
3. **Immediate Threats**: Scammers often use fear tactics (e.g., seizure of assets) to manipulate victims into immediate action without verifying the legitimacy of the claim.
4. **Verify Payment Links**: Always check the origin of payment links, especially if directed to iDeal or other payment gateways via suspicious means.
5. **Stay Informed**: Regularly check with official agencies (like the Dutch Tax Office) regarding any real outstanding debts. Scams often use urgency to force victims into compliance.
6. **Report Phishing**: If you receive such scams, report them to relevant authorities like domain registrars, hosting providers, and payment services to minimize the damage done.
