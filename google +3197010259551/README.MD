# Scam Report: Hardware Wallet Gmail Verification Scam

**Scam Date**: June 2025  

**Status**: Ongoing

---

## Scam Summary  
This is a sophisticated social engineering scam targeting cryptocurrency users through SMS, falsely claiming that a hardware wallet request has been made using the victim's Gmail account. The scammer attempts to create urgency and fear by suggesting unauthorized access, hoping victims will call the provided number to "verify" or "cancel" the supposed request. When victims call the number, they encounter a professional-sounding fake Google customer service system designed to extract sensitive information.

**Initial SMS Message:**
> "Een aanvraag voor een hardware wallet is gedaan met uw Gmail. Was u dit niet? Reageer via: +3197010259551"

Translation: "A request for a hardware wallet has been made with your Gmail. Wasn't this you? Respond via: +3197010259551"

**Phone System Audio (when calling +31 97010 259551):**
> "Welkom bij Google. Bedankt voor het contact opnemen met ons. Alle medewerkers zijn op dit moment in gesprek. U wordt zo spoedig mogelijk doorverbonden met een medewerker.

## Scam Tactics  
### 1. False Urgency and Fear Creation  
The message creates immediate anxiety by suggesting someone has used the victim's Gmail to request a hardware wallet without their permission. This taps into cryptocurrency users' legitimate concerns about account security and unauthorized access to their financial services.

### 2. Vague Entity Impersonation  
Rather than impersonating a specific company like Ledger or Trezor, the scammers use generic "hardware wallet" terminology. This makes the scam applicable to users of any hardware wallet brand and avoids immediate detection by specific companies' fraud monitoring.

### 3. Sophisticated Phone System Impersonation  
The scammers have set up a convincing fake Google customer service phone system with professional Dutch voice recordings and menu options. When victims call +31 97010 259551, they hear an automated message claiming to be Google support, complete with hold music and professional terminology. This sophisticated setup increases victim trust and makes the scam appear legitimate.

### 4. Phone-Based Social Engineering  
By directing victims to call a phone number, scammers can engage in real-time social engineering, potentially extracting sensitive information like Gmail passwords, two-factor authentication codes, or even cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases.

### 5. Pattern Recognition
This follows established cryptocurrency phishing patterns documented in recent hardware wallet scams targeting Ledger, Trezor, and other major brands. Legitimate hardware wallet companies would never contact you via text, and more often than not, they would delete your contact details after a certain time period, depending on their privacy policy.

## Lessons & Takeaways  
### 1. Red Flags & Prevention  
- **Unsolicited hardware wallet messages**: Legitimate hardware wallet companies would never contact you via text
- **Generic terminology**: Real companies use specific branding and clear sender identification
- **Phone number requests**: Legitimate services use official support channels, not random phone numbers
