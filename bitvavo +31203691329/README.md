## Lessons & Takeaways

### 1. Red Flags & Prevention

- **Unsolicited SMS about password resets with a phone number**  
  Always verify directly via the official Bitvavo or Ledger website ‚Äî *never* through links or numbers provided in a message.

- **Urgency to call a landline to ‚Äústop unauthorized access‚Äù**  
  Scammers create pressure to trigger impulsive actions. Always take a moment to verify the claim.

- **Reference codes like `BITXXXX` that appear official**  
  These are fake but designed to look trustworthy. Real platforms use secure in-app messaging, not generic SMS codes.

- **Follow-up calls from ‚ÄúLedger Support‚Äù**  
  Ledger explicitly states it will **never** contact users by phone. Any such call is a scam.

- **Mentions of suspicious logins from abroad (e.g., Germany)**  
  This scare tactic is used to extract sensitive information like wallet recovery phrases. Never share your seed phrase under any circumstance.

### 2. How to Stay Safe  
- Never trust links or phone numbers in unsolicited messages.  
- Report scams to relevant authorities as soon as possible.
