# Telephone Fraud

## Overview
Telephone scams remain a widespread method for defrauding individuals. Scammers often **spoof caller IDs** to appear as legitimate businesses, banks, or government agencies. They use psychological manipulation, pressure tactics, and threats to trick victims into providing personal information or making payments.

## Common Types of Telephone Fraud

### 1. **Bank Impersonation Fraud**
- Scammers pose as bank employees warning of **unauthorized transactions**.
- They request **login credentials or security codes** to "verify" the victimâ€™s identity.
- Some scams involve remote access software (e.g., AnyDesk, TeamViewer).

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: A Dutch pensioner lost **â‚¬25,000** after "ING Bank" called claiming fraudulent activity on his account. The scammer gained remote access and transferred the money.

### 2. **Tech Support Scams**
- Callers claim to be from **Microsoft, Apple, or another IT company**.
- They warn of a "virus" and request remote access to "fix" the issue.
- Often leads to **stolen passwords or ransomware installation**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: A victim was tricked into installing software that stole his online banking credentials.

### 3. **Government Threats & Tax Scams**
- Callers impersonate **Belastingdienst (Dutch Tax Office)** or other government agencies.
- They demand immediate payment to avoid **arrest or asset seizure**.
- Usually linked to **fraudulent payment portals**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: A Dutch citizen was told he owed **â‚¬475** and had to pay via an iDEAL link to avoid "legal consequences."

### 4. **Spoofed Caller ID Fraud**
- Scammers manipulate caller IDs to make it seem like a **legitimate company is calling**.
- If the victim calls back, they often reach the **real company**, causing confusion.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Fraudsters called victims pretending to be from **Rabobank** using a spoofed number. Victims only realized the scam after calling back and reaching the real Rabobank.
