# Telephone Fraud

## Overview
Telephone scams involve fraudsters posing as legitimate organizations to extract personal information or money.

## Common Tactics
- **Bank Impersonation**: Scammers claim to be from a bank, warning about unauthorized transactions.
- **Tech Support Fraud**: Calls from fake IT support claiming your device has been hacked.
- **Government Threats**: Fake tax authorities demanding immediate payment to avoid legal action.
- **Spoofed Caller ID**: Attackers manipulate caller IDs to appear as legitimate organizations.

## Real-World Case
A Dutch victim was threatened by a scammer who claimed to have heard children in the background and suggested they would send someone to their house. This highlights the lengths scammers go to intimidate targets.

## Prevention
- Never share sensitive data over the phone.
- Hang up and verify the caller through official channels.
- Enable call filtering/blocking for unknown numbers.
