# Social Media Scams

## Overview
Social media platforms have become a major tool for scammers. The ability to create fake accounts, buy advertising, and use sophisticated algorithms allows fraud to spread quickly. Many users assume that because an ad appears on a major platform, it must be legitimateâ€”but that is not the case.

## Common Social Media Scams

### 1. **Fake Investment Ads**
- Scammers use deepfake videos or stolen images of celebrities to promote fake investment platforms.
- Victims are encouraged to deposit money into fraudulent trading platforms.
- Often linked to **Bitcoin scams**, promising unrealistic returns.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Russian scammers allegedly stole **â‚¬110 million** by using Dutch celebrity images in scam ads. An estimated **â‚¬60 million** of that was reinvested into social media advertising, making the platforms complicit in spreading fraud.

### 2. **Marketplace Fraud**
- Fake sellers list non-existent products on platforms like Facebook Marketplace.
- They demand **prepayment** and then disappear.
- Some scams involve **hijacked accounts** of real sellers to build trust.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: A Dutch Facebook user lost **â‚¬800** after purchasing an e-bike from what appeared to be a real seller. The account had been hacked, and the scammer used it to request payments via Tikkie.

### 3. **Impersonation Scams**
- Scammers create fake profiles of **banks, government agencies, or well-known companies**.
- They send messages offering "support" but aim to **steal login credentials** or demand "verification payments."

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Victims reported fake ING Bank pages asking customers to enter their bank details to "prevent account closure."

### 4. **Phishing & Data Harvesting**
- Social media quizzes that ask for "fun facts" (e.g., "What was your first pet's name?") are often used to collect security question answers.
- Fake giveaway contests trick users into sharing sensitive details.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Scammers set up a "Win a Free iPhone" contest where users entered personal information that was later used for identity theft.

## How to Protect Yourself
âœ… Be skeptical of investment ads promising high returns.  
âœ… Never prepay for items on marketplacesâ€”use secure payment methods.  
âœ… Verify social media pages using official company websites.  
âœ… Avoid sharing personal information through quizzes or contests.  
âœ… Report fake accounts and ads to the platform immediately.
