# Social Media Scams

## Overview
Social media scams exploit platform algorithms to spread fraudulent ads, impersonations, and fake investment schemes. 

## Common Scams
- **Fake Investment Ads**: Scammers use deepfake videos of celebrities to promote fake cryptocurrency or investment platforms.
- **Marketplace Fraud**: Fake sellers list non-existent products, often demanding prepayment.
- **Impersonation Scams**: Fraudsters create fake profiles of companies or individuals to deceive users into making payments.
