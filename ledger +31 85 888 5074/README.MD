## Source Analysis  
- The message **impersonates Ledger**, a well-known hardware wallet provider.  
- **Ledger does not send SMS alerts** for login activities or suspicious account access.  
- The provided phone number (+31858885074) is a **VoIP number**, registered to Voxbone SA (now part of Bandwidth.com), used by scammers to obscure their true identity.  
- When called, the number routes victims through a **menu system** that mimics authentic Ledger support, eventually connecting them to a scammer posing as a Ledger representative.

## Scam Tactics

### 1. Urgency & Fear  
- The alert creates panic by notifying the recipient of an alleged unauthorized login from Stockholm, prompting an immediate reaction.  
- The inclusion of specific time and location details is designed to enhance the scam’s credibility.

### 2. Fake Customer Support  
- The VoIP number directs the victim to a scam call center where they navigate a **fake menu system** that imitates legitimate Ledger support channels.  
- Once through the system, a scammer posing as a Ledger representative attempts to extract sensitive information.

### 3. Social Engineering  
- The scammer’s objective is to obtain:  
  - The **24-word Ledger recovery phrase** (which should never be shared).  
  - **Ledger Live login credentials**.  
  - **Remote access** to the victim’s device.  
- These tactics exploit the recipient's fear and urgency, making them more likely to divulge confidential data.

### 4. Account Takeover & Theft  
- If the victim provides sensitive details such as their recovery phrase, the scammer can immediately gain control of the account and access all crypto assets.  
- This underscores the need for immediate caution and protective measures.
