## Scam Summary  

This scam targeted cryptocurrency users by impersonating **LEDGER**, a well-known hardware wallet provider. Victims received fraudulent text messages urging them to **validate their wallets immediately** to avoid restrictions. The messages directed users to a **phishing website (updatewallet-ledger.com)** that mimicked LEDGERâ€™s official site.

Once on the fake website, victims were instructed to select their wallet type and **enter their recovery phrase**, which was then **sent to a Telegram group controlled by scammers**. A fake **loading spinner** was displayed to make the process appear legitimate.  

The phishing domain was hosted by **Cloudflare**, registered through **Ultahost, Inc.**, and lacked proper email authentication (SPF/DMARC), making it a clear red flag. Despite reports, the domain remained active for several days before being flagged across cybersecurity platforms.
