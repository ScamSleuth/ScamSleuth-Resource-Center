# Bitvavo-info.site 
## Phishing - August 2024

**Status**: Resolved

---

### Scam Summary:
Victims received alarming text messages claiming: 

*"Het 2FA-telefoonnummer is aangepast. Dit nummer is niet langer in gebruik voor beveiligde toegang. Weet u hier niets van? Annuleer via https://bitvavo-info.site".* 

Translation: "Your 2FA phone number has been changed. This number is no longer in use for secure access. If you're unaware of this change, cancel via https://bitvavo-info.site."

- **Number Spoofing**: The scammers [spoofed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID_spoofing) the senderâ€™s phone number, making it appear as though the message originated from Bitvavo itself. This added to the message's credibility and increased the likelihood of victims falling for the scam.

### What Happened:
- **Phishing Tactics**: The link in the text message directed mobile users to a fake site ([bitvavo-info.site](https://bitvavo-info.site)), which then redirected them to another fraudulent domain, [bitvavosecurise.com](https://bitvavosecurise.com). Here, users were prompted to enter their Bitvavo login credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the scammers.
  
- **Misdirection**: On desktop devices, both domains instead presented a copy with altered (erroneous) links of the Oslo University Hospital (Oslo Universitetssykehus) website, further disguising the scam.

### Actions Taken:
- After discovering the scam, I conducted a [WHOIS](https://who.is) lookup for both domains and filed abuse reports with the respective registrars. 
  - **bitvavo-info.site** was registered with [Dynadot](https://www.dynadot.com/report-abuse), which responded quickly and took the necessary actions to address the abuse.
  - **bitvavosecurise.com** was registered with [OwnRegistrar](https://ownregistrar.com/abuse/), and they also took swift action to shut down the fraudulent domain.

- **Missed Step**: In this case, we forgot to investigate where the phishing websites were actually hosted. This could have been different from where the domains were registered. Ideally, I should have traced the IP address to identify the hosting provider for a more complete takedown process.

### Lessons & Takeaways:
- **Stay Alert**: Be cautious of unsolicited messages, especially those urging immediate action or sharing suspicious links. 
- **Verify URLs**: Always check the legitimacy of URLs before clicking, particularly if you receive unexpected security alerts.
- **Be Aware of Spoofing**: Scammers can spoof phone numbers to make their messages seem more legitimate, so be cautious even when the sender appears to be trusted.
- **Report Scams**: If you come across phishing attempts, report them to the appropriate registrars, trace the IP address to identify the hosting provider, and inform the affected service provider.
