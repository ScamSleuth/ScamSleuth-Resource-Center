# Scam Report: Bybit/"Ledger Support" Impersonation

**Scam Date:** September 2025

**Status:** Ongoing

## Scam Summary
Victims receive an SMS that appears to come from Bybit, claiming a new device has been linked to their portfolio and instructing them to call a Dutch number immediately. When called, an English-speaking agent probes for details about the victim‚Äôs crypto holdings. If the victim mentions using a Ledger hardware wallet, the call is conveniently ‚Äútransferred‚Äù to a supposed Ledger agent who claims they can investigate the issue. This ‚ÄúLedger‚Äù representative is part of the scam operation and attempts to gain access to accounts or wallet recovery phrases.

**Fraudulent SMS Example (NL):**
"U heeft een nieuw toestel succesvol gekoppeld aan uw portfolio. Herkent u dit niet? Bel direct +31 591 794 013"

**Translation:**
"You have successfully linked a new device to your portfolio. Don‚Äôt recognize this? Call +31 591 794 013 immediately"

## Source Analysis
**Impersonated Entities:** Bybit (crypto exchange), Ledger (hardware wallet)
**Initial Scam Channel:** SMS (smishing), sender appears to be ‚ÄúBybit‚Äù
**Phone Number Used (SMS/Callback):** +31 591 794 013
**Provider:** MaxiTEL (as reported)

## Scam Tactics
1. Device-linked alert to trigger urgency
A sudden ‚Äúnew device linked‚Äù message pressures recipients to act immediately.

2. Call-to-action via Dutch number
A Netherlands number adds perceived legitimacy and urgency to call right away.

3. English-speaking operator probing holdings
The first agent asks about crypto balances and platforms used.

4. "Warm transfer" to fake Ledger support
If Ledger is mentioned, callers are ‚Äútransferred‚Äù to a supposed Ledger agent who claims to investigate the ‚Äúcompromise.‚Äù This is part of the scam escalation.

5. Data extraction and potential remote-access attempt
The fake support may seek recovery phrases, 2FA codes, or try to persuade installation of remote-access tools to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù assets.

## Lessons & Takeaways

### 1. Red Flags & Prevention

- **Unsolicited SMS about password resets with a phone number**  
  Always verify directly via the official Bitvavo or Ledger website ‚Äî *never* through links or numbers provided in a message.

- **Urgency to call a landline to ‚Äústop unauthorized access‚Äù**  
  Scammers create pressure to trigger impulsive actions. Always take a moment to verify the claim.

- **Reference codes like `BITXXXX` that appear official**  
  These are fake but designed to look trustworthy. Real platforms use secure in-app messaging, not generic SMS codes.

- **Follow-up calls from ‚ÄúLedger Support‚Äù**  
  Ledger explicitly states it will **never** contact users by phone. Any such call is a scam.

- **Mentions of suspicious logins from abroad (e.g., Germany)**  
  This scare tactic is used to extract sensitive information like wallet recovery phrases. Never share your seed phrase under any circumstance.
