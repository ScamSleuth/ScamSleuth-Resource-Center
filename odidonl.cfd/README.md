# Scam Report: Odido Phone Number Expiry Scam

**Scam Date**: July, 2025  
**Status**: Ongoing

---

## Scam Summary  
This scam targets customers of Dutch mobile provider **Odido**, using urgency and impersonation to trick recipients into visiting a phishing site and entering sensitive personal data. Victims receive an SMS claiming that their phone number will expire soon unless they act. The phishing site at `odidonl.cfd` mimics a legitimate service and walks victims through multiple fake verification stages.

> "Beste ODIDO klant,  
> Uw telefoonnummer verloopt op 26.07.2025. Om uw nummer te behouden ga naar : https://odidonl.cfd/K8IjL9/1M3k/1391"

> _"Dear ODIDO customer,  
> Your phone number will expire on 26.07.2025. To retain your number, visit: https://odidonl.cfd/K8IjL9/1M3k/1391"_

## Scam Tactics  

### 1. Urgency and Fear of Loss  
The SMS claims that the victim's phone number will expire soon, pushing them to act immediately without verifying the source.

### 2. Convincing Imitation  
The phishing site mimics a login or identity verification portal and walks the user through various fake steps (`login`, `identificatie`, `bellen`, `signeercode`, etc.), each meant to capture different types of data.

### 3. Reused Infrastructure  
The presence of a redirect to a Swiss bank suggests the phishing kit was copied or modified from an earlier campaign and reused without full cleanup.
