**Scam Date**: April, 2025

## Scam Summary

Scammers use SMS messages claiming recipients must update their business information by a specific deadline, likely to harvest sensitive business or personal data.

## Source Analysis
* **Impersonated Entity**: Kamer van Koophandel (Dutch Chamber of Commerce)
* **Scammer's Contact Method**: SMS
* **Website Used**: https://kvkvoorwaarden-check.de
* **Hosting Provider/Registrar**: CLOUDFLARENET-EU

## Scam Tactics
1. **Impersonation & Fear Tactics**
   The scammer impersonates the official Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) by using its name in the message. They create a sense of urgency by setting a specific deadline (April 13, 2025), implying negative consequences if the recipient doesn't comply.

2. **Fraudulent Website & Data Theft**
   The scam utilizes a fraudulent domain (kvkvoorwaarden-check.de) with a German (.de) TLD instead of the expected Dutch (.nl) domain that would be used by the legitimate KVK. The website was recently created, as evidenced by its SSL certificate only being valid from April 11, 2025. The fraudulent website collects extensive personal and financial information through a form, including full name, date of birth, address, phone number, bank account details (IBAN), and email address. This information is then automatically sent to the scammers via Telegram messaging.

## Technical Analysis
1. **Domain Analysis**
   * Domain: kvkvoorwaarden-check.de
   * Uses German (.de) TLD instead of Dutch (.nl)
   * SSL Certificate issued by Google Trust Services, valid from April 11, 2025 to July 10, 2025
   * "Hosted" on CloudFlare servers (IP: 188.114.96.0, 188.114.97.0)
   * WHOIS information is incomplete (no registrar, creation date, or expiration date)

2. **Security Indicators**
   * No DNSSEC enabled
   * No SPF records found
   * No DMARC records found
   * No DKIM records found
   * Not currently blacklisted by OpenPhish

3. **Website Code Analysis**
   * The website is designed to mimic the official KVK website, including the official KVK logo
   * Uses Bootstrap for styling and responsive design
   * Contains a data collection form that requests highly sensitive personal and financial information:
     - First name and last name
     - Date of birth
     - Home address and postal code
     - Mobile phone number
     - Bank account number (IBAN)
     - Email address
   
4. **Data Exfiltration Method**
   * The website uses a Telegram bot API to exfiltrate victim data
   * When a user submits the form, all personal information is formatted into a message
   * The data is sent via AJAX to the Telegram API using bot token: "7093117111:AAEbFu4cFcrrEeFjhdjuy-pl5h0LgKokG4g"
   * Information is delivered to Telegram chat ID: "-1002643349602"
   * After successful data exfiltration, the victim is redirected to the legitimate KVK privacy policy page (https://www.kvk.nl/over-kvk/kvk-privacyverklaring-pdf/) to avoid suspicion
   * The script appears to capture the victim's IP address and includes it in the data sent to Telegram, making it even more dangerous for identity theft purposes

5. **Connection to Previous KVK Scams**
   * This scam shows strong resemblance to a previously documented scam at ["mijnkvk.digital"](https://github.com/ScamSleuth/ScamSleuth-Resource-Center/tree/main/mijnkvk.digital).

## Countermeasures
To disrupt the scammers' operation, a Python script has been developed to flood their Telegram channel with fake but realistic-looking Dutch personal data. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Data Pollution**: By flooding the channel with thousands of fake entries, legitimate stolen data becomes difficult to identify among the noise.

2. **Resource Exhaustion**: The constant stream of messages can overwhelm the scammers' ability to process incoming data effectively.

3. **Operational Disruption**: Scammers may waste time attempting to use fake information, reducing their overall efficiency.

The countermeasure script:
- Uses the Python `faker` library with Dutch locale to generate realistic Dutch personal information
- Mimics the exact format of data sent by the actual phishing site
- Sends data directly to the same Telegram bot and channel used by the scammers
- Generates random:
  * Names and addresses
  * Dutch-format mobile numbers
  * Valid-looking IBAN numbers
  * Date of birth values
  * IP addresses
  * Message IDs

This technique effectively poisons the scammers' data collection and introduces significant doubt about which data entries might be legitimate, potentially rendering their entire operation less effective.

## Actions Taken
1. **Domain & Hosting Reports**
   * Report generated using ScamTrail on April 12, 2025 at 02:52:42 UTC

2. **Third-Party Reports**
   * Inform the legitimate KVK (kvk.nl) about the impersonation
   * Report to Dutch cybercrime authorities (Fraudehelpdesk.nl)

3. **Telegram Bot Reporting**
   * Report the Telegram bot (token: 7093117111:AAEbFu4cFcrrEeFjhdjuy-pl5h0LgKokG4g) for abuse
   * Report the Telegram chat/channel (ID: -1002643349602) where stolen data is being sent
