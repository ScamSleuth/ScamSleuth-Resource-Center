## Scam Tactics
1. **Impersonation & Fear Tactics**
   The scammer impersonates the official Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) by using its name in the message. They create a sense of urgency by setting a specific deadline (April 13, 2025), implying negative consequences if the recipient doesn't comply.
